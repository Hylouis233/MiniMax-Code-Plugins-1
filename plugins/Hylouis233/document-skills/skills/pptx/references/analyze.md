# Analyze / triage a deck

## Content inventory

```python
from pptx import Presentation
prs = Presentation("input.pptx")
print("slide size:", prs.slide_width, prs.slide_height)
for i, slide in enumerate(prs.slides):
    layout = slide.slide_layout.name
    title = slide.shapes.title.text_frame.text if slide.shapes.title is not None else ""
    notes = slide.notes_slide.notes_text_frame.text if slide.has_notes_slide else ""
    n_tables = sum(1 for sh in slide.shapes if sh.has_table)
    n_charts = sum(1 for sh in slide.shapes if sh.has_chart)
    n_pics = sum(1 for sh in slide.shapes if sh.shape_type == 13)
    print(i, layout, repr(title[:40]), "tables:", n_tables, "charts:", n_charts,
          "pics:", n_pics, "notes:", len(notes))
```

(Simplify the title lookup to `slide.shapes.title` when present; the defensive loop is for
layouts where the title placeholder is missing.)

## Triage: deck renders wrong

| Symptom | Check | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Shape crosses the slide edge | compare all four shape bounds with the slide bounds | move or resize the shape |
| Text is clipped or overflows its box | render every slide and inspect right/left and bottom/vertical fit; shape bounds do not measure laid-out text | reflow, resize the box, or reduce text/font size, then render again |
| Everything shifted | slide size changed between sources | normalize slide size or re-layout on the target size |
| Fonts look wrong elsewhere | non-embedded fonts (pptx rarely embeds) | report referenced fonts (`run.font.name`) |
| File will not open | broken ZIP / part mismatch | same programmatic health check as DOCX: `zipfile.testzip()`, parse every `.xml` part |
| Pictures blank | media parts missing or rels broken | verify `ppt/media/*` present and slide rels reference them |

## Text-fit verification

`python-pptx` exposes a text box's geometry, not the renderer's final glyph and line layout.
After any text or layout change, render all slides with the fonts used in production:

```bash
python -c "from pathlib import Path; Path('deck-render').mkdir(exist_ok=True)"
soffice --headless --convert-to pdf --outdir deck-render input.pptx
```

Inspect every page of `deck-render/input.pdf` for horizontal clipping and for the final line being
clipped or missing at the bottom. Rasterize the PDF when image inspection is easier. If this must
be an automated gate, use measured text bounds from a native renderer in both axes;
`shape.left + shape.width` is only a slide-boundary check, not an overflow test.

## Report contract

Summarize: slide count, per-slide one-line inventory, then findings ranked by user impact.
Extraction for repurposing goes to markdown with speaker notes preserved as blockquotes.
